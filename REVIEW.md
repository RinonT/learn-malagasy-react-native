# Review for your malagasy app

_If you have any questions regarding the review, please come see me._

To explain the grading for each individual component, please see comments in those files.
General Issues:

1. Components should be language agnostic
2. Naming should be more precise in some places, less specific in others.
3. Try do reduce complexity and the amount of states needed to control your app. Instead, use states that store more information.
